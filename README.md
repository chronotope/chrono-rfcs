# Chrono RFCs

Discussion space for the long-term planning of Chrono.

## Repository Organization

* [Notes](./notes): Scratch space/git-powered wiki for longer-form notes.
  This is just like a GitHub wiki except I can add images.

That's all there is right now. Feel free to open tickets or PRs, no matter how
minor.
